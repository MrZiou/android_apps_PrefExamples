Preference Examples by n00bware

I got tired trying to figure out the docs from
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/preference/package-summary.html

SO I wrote an extremely simple app that shows some of the possible
uses of the standard android frameworks implementation of preferences

I choose the WTFPL license for good reason I really wanted to people to use these
examples to make their life easier

I kept the string names and method names simple and descriptive (they can be anything)

--> Make note of the branches I placed each preference in it's own branch
        the branches are done in order (default branch is EditTextPreference and
        was the first example)

Examples in order:
EditTextPreference ~/\~ https://github.com/n00bware/android_apps_PrefExamples
ListPreference ~{-}~ https://github.com/n00bware/android_apps_PrefExamples/tree/ListPreference
CheckBoxPreference ~\/~ https://github.com/n00bware/android_apps_PrefExamples/tree/CheckBoxPreference
